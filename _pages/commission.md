## So you want a commission
Great! I am very easy to get along and work with. Here's what to do:

Contact me on discord (harmonymotion#2098) or email (harmonymotionfiction@gmail.com)

### Writing
1. Let me know what kind of story you want.
- Kinks, specific story beats, that kind of stuff. Things that are important to you that you cannot do without. The more you tell, the less I'll ask :)
2. I will work with you and draft an outline.
3. Once you sign off, I begin writing in earnest.
- You will have full access to the document as I work, any time you like.
4. Give me feedback, either during or after I am finished writing.
5. I touch it up based on your feedback and give it a final edit.
6. Enjoy the finished product!

### Art
Give me as much detail as possible. How the character looks physically (eye color, face shape, hair color, body shape, lips, nose, everything... mold it all to your desire.) What is he or she wearing? Details, details, details.

Pose, scenery, expression.

We will generate a preview for you to examine.

If you are okay with it, we produce the final piece of art.

**If you want any changes, the time to call it out is during the preview phase! We will accommodate changes after the final piece is complete, but excessive tweaks will cost more!**

We own and retain the rights to our work.

### Prices
Story: 4-5c a word. Rate varies depending on content.
Art: $30 an image, plus $10 for initial creation of model.

We charge half upfront and half upon completion.
