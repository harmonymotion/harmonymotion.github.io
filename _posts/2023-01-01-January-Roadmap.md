Happy new year!!!

To start off the year, here's what we have planned:


### **Commissions**

* A short transformation/beautydom story
* A short shy omni story
* A breast expansion story
* An attribute theft/futa story


### **Patreon**

* 2-3 Entries of DPS
* Mary and Stu Super Supporter pack (will be delivered to last month's Super Supporters as well)
* NSFW pack


### **Shard-Strike Universe**

...is on hold right now! For this month, I will be releasing a detective story, Ryan Reyes and the Case of Lydia Meyers, on my Gumroad for the high, high price of $0! I'll make an announcement when it's ready.

I hope everyone made realistic resolutions to usher in 2023! :D
