## Chapter 1

“You wanna buy me a drink?” Sue Bennet shouted over the bone-chattering drumbeat of the Ice Temple nightclub.

Her target gave her an appraising look, repeated the up and down scan, then pursed his lips and whistled. It was inaudible.

“Well?” she shouted again. “You gonna buy me a drink, or what? I’m not going to ask again.”

“Sorry honey,” he yelled back with a sad smirk on his face. “Women like you are trouble.” He raised his glass and prepared to drink his own shot of liquor.

But her slender fingers gripped his forearm and easily halted his movement.

“Hey! Ow!” he yelled, loud enough to be heard by everyone around him.

“I told you I wasn’t going to ask again. _You want to buy me a drink_.”

Her tone became dark. Compelling. Her fingers squeezed his flesh as her voice bore its way into his pliable mind. His lips went slack as his entire body shook, swirling the clear liquor in his shot glass. The fluid in his eyes rippled, matching the rhythmic beat of the music as his pupils dilated.

Finally, her command had taken hold. He turned to his beautiful, blonde mistress.

“What’ll you have?” he shouted.

“I thought you’d never ask. Tequila. On the rocks. He’s paying.” She looked at the bartender, anticipating—no, _hoping_ that he’d give her a reason to mentally dominate him as well.

The bartender chuckled and shrugged. He reached beneath the glowing bar, grabbed a shot glass with a practiced flourish, and scooped a few cubes of ice. He tilted the glugging thin stream of liquid into the clear, wide glass, raising the bottle higher as he finished the pour.

“Put it on my tab,” her thrall stated confidently. “Want to dance?” He looked at her with his lust-filled, not-quite-his-own gaze.

“Mmm… No.”

Sue left him there in a daze, letting his mind put itself back together. They always came back to their senses within a few minutes if she wasn’t there to continue dominating and controlling them, but no matter. Beautiful, supple, and strong, Sue Bennett looked like a supermodel while having the strength of about ten of them.

Her red heels clacked against the glass cubes that made up Ice Temple Club’s floor. Their whole gimmick was—well, it was in the name. The decor looked permanently chilled with bright lights illuminating the dance floor from below. Some actual ice sculptures kept in reasonable shape decorated the sides of the club. A good place to linger and mingle when you’d had your fill moving and grooving and needed a more intimate place to cool down and talk to the stranger you’d just grinded.

And hanging from the middle of the ceiling, a large plastic snowflake covered in sparkling glitter reflected the gyrating multicolored lights of the club.

Sue loved this place the first time she laid eyes on their promotion ad card. But she had been just a below-average-looking girl, lacking confidence, meekly waiting outside in the cold while the bouncers waved more beautiful women forward and let them in without a cover fee.

But after a Shard Strike did her the good fortune of searing her body with cold heat, the mysterious, ethereal tendrils of flame lashing at her body, she’d come out not as a pile of ashes, but as an absolute stunner. Tall, leggy as all hell, breasts out to there, and reinvigorated, long strands of  golden silk that she called her hair. They framed her elfin face perfectly as it flowed down her shoulders, all the way to her lower back.

She looked a thousand times better than the women that Ice Temple Club had taken before her.

And the _power_ too!

The strength was fun and convenient. Opening jars was never a problem anymore. She wasn’t all _that_ strong. Not compared to some of the other famous paranaturals like Marathon. But Sue could easily hold her own against an unpowered. In fact, now seemed like a good time to try it out.

She strode up to the large square area of the dance floor to the tune of Ice, Ice, Baby. Intruding her way in between a dancing couple, Sue took the lead by grabbing the fellow’s hand and cocking her hip into the woman’s side, sending her crashing into other people a few feet away.

There was a slight kerfuffle as the hip-checked girl apologized profusely in embarrassment. Then she looked back at Sue and scowled.

“The hell are you doing? I’m with her!” He shouted at Sue.

But Sue was touching his hands. She could feel his mind vulnerable to her total control, but that was only part of the plan.

She slithered into his embrace, wrapping her arms behind his back as she pressed her bountiful bosoms into his buttoned shirt. Sue grinded against him, feeling his burgeoning erection from her seduction—and she wasn’t too big to admit, her mental command. She rubbed her pussy against his fully erect manhood through her little black dress, making sure to give the woman a show as she bit her lip, fluttered her half-lidded eyes, and moaned.

“Steve! What are you doing! Get away from her!” the slightly battered woman yelled as she approached.

He placed his arms on Sue’s bare shoulders and tried to push, but she was going nowhere. She continued to grind, brushing her stiff nipples against his chest. The touch was electric, and the feeling of her power even more so.

“I… can’t!” he yelled back as he struggled against this svelte beauty’s shocking strength.

“What do you mean you can’t!”

“I mean…” he began to stutter.

Sue poured it on for real now, clawing into his mind with abandon. Baring her gleaming teeth like a predator about to strike, she finished implanting her commands and allowed him to answer his date or whatever.

“Get lost, whatever your name is. I’m with Sue now,” he spat coldly as he wrapped his strong arms around Sue’s svelte shape.

Sue gave the woman a sneer as she leaned her pert breasts into his body and rested her head on his shoulder, her blonde hair spilling over beautifully.

“The hell you say!”

The outraged woman stomped back and tried to pry Sue’s clutches away from her date, but a slight shrug flung the woman’s arm away. The woman finally realized she was outclassed, but it was too late.

Sue’s steely arm shot out. The paranatural blonde wrapped her fingers around the woman’s throat.

Her eyes widened as she suddenly found it hard to breathe. She struggled against Sue’s iron grip, but that slender limb belied her true strength.

She didn’t have to worry for long, however. She felt a sudden desire to go grind up against the guy at the bar. Yes, the dopey one who sat there, looking stunned and confused. God, he was sexy! Why hadn’t she introduced herself to him immediately?

She couldn’t even feel the pain around her neck anymore. In fact, the entire event was forgotten. The controlled woman stumbled clumsily past the crowded dance floor in her single-minded urgency to rub her body against that stranger. No plans beyond that. Just a nice grind.

Sue laughed and tossed her hair back as she watched her latest puppet wander off on her evil little whim. Her boy toy stood frozen there per her instruction. She was done with him.

Beautiful, strong, _and_ mentally unopposable. The world was Sue’s oyster. She would rule it, and the people would love her for it.

Drifting through the sea of bodies gracefully like a hot knife through butter, her glancing touch subjugated all of the club goers one at a time. Her creativity waned as all of them began to strip naked, male and female. They all gathered into a large ball at the center of the dance floor, mindlessly humping and groping, naked flesh bumping against naked flesh.

Two of them she sent toward the live band. They began to climb up onto the stage to fuck like bunnies in front of the whole club. Sue followed behind them, planning to use her thralls as a distraction as she planned to sneak up behind and dominate the merry musicmakers.

“A little less over the top, and I’d have asked you to leave. Now I’m _ordering_ you to get out,” a female voice overpowered the roar of the music even at this close proximity to the speakers.

She turned to look at the woman who owned that voice. Tall. Taller than her. Strange, ill-fitting loose clothes.

“You?” she scoffed. “Who the fuck are you?” Sue began to approach the woman threateningly.

“I’m the bouncer,” she replied without hesitation.

Sue reached out and squeezed the bouncer’s arm tightly with her fingers.

“Get lost. Don’t bother me while I’m having fun,” she ordered.

But something wasn’t right. Sue didn’t feel the tall, borderline amazonian woman bending to her will.

She smirked in response. “Something wrong?”

“Why… aren’t… you…” Sue continued to try and break through the bouncer’s defenses, but nothing worked!

“You know this is one of LA’s top para clubs, right? We get punks like you twice a month. TIme to go, little birdie.”

The woman twisted Sue’s arm behind her back and hefted, restricting the troublemaker’s movement as she publicly and demonstrably marched her toward the Ice Temple’s disgraceful exit.

But Sue wasn’t done yet. So she couldn’t make this brutish woman dance like a puppet. She still had her strength!

Sue twisted and bucked, clearly catching the enforcer by surprise. Her slim arm was so much stronger than it appeared, after all.

“RAAAA!” she screamed as she broke free, putting all her force into her shove against the bouncer lady. She sounded experienced, and Sue knew she wouldn’t have to pull any punches.

The brawny brunette slid across the ice-emulating glass dance floor. Quite appropriately, even. Sue smirked, dusting her hands off as the bouncer who’d dared strongarm her crashed into the stage where the band was playing.

She expected a gasp of astonishment from the crowd. An acknowledgement of her power. Her status. Her rightful place at the top of the food chain.

Instead, the band shifted music without missing a beat. They cut their current Latin jazz dance number as the drummer began a low, ominous drumroll that began to accelerando and crescendo.

The brass blared loudly on cue as the drummer slammed both snares.

“FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!” yelled the singer into the microphone.

Sue was flabbergasted. What the hell was happening? Was she part of some scripted fight!? Because she definitely hadn’t gotten the script!

The bouncer climbed to her feet, apparently completely unharmed. There was a large, cracked dent in the stage where she’d impacted.

ONE-two-three ONE-two-three ONE-two drum beats, followed by stabbing brass fanfare. The immune to Sue’s-mind-control lady rotated her shoulders, cracked her knuckles, and craned her neck back and forth. Large, deep rivulets of veins bulged through her entire body as the thundering popping of her bones overpowered even the fight music that played all too smoothly to be improvised.

The crowd got out of the way while gathering behind to watch the upcoming big event.

Her opponent’s clothes were no longer loose. As she stepped into the proverbial ring with no boundaries, made of glass and ice, her already large stature became even more enormous. The brunette enforcer appeared to be gaining height; no, it wasn’t just the fact that she was approaching. She really was getting taller!

And to wipe away any trace of doubt in Sue’s mind, that woman’s biceps and triceps packed on mountains of muscle, those peaks of power growing ever higher. God, even her forearms and wrists looked _thick!_ Her suddenly too-tight top began to rip, like some sort of hulking out comic book character. The color green came to Sue’s mind for some reason.

The woman’s shredded abs were in stark view now. Each brick of muscle looked hard enough to serve as an anvil to work metal on. And how many abs did she have? How many could a human actually own!? Because she looked like she owned double.

The woman’s already thick thighs bulged with muscle too. Her quads and hamstrings kept on increasing in size, far beyond what would be considered natural. Clearly she’d planned for the occasion, since the waistband of her pants stretched to the limit and began to creak… but no further. Sue almost felt sorry for those pants. Almost. What she was really beginning to feel sorry for was herself.

Some of the non-troublesome paranaturals in the crowd suddenly found themselves experiencing vertigo. The world spun for them as they closed their eyelids and rubbed their throbbing eyeballs. The strange, uncomfortable, arrhythmic beating sensation in their bodies  overtook even the rhythmic pulsing from the band. Some of the paranaturals gifted with flight powers suddenly found themselves unsteadily wobbling in the air before crashing down.

Sue was feeling it too. This woman was far too confident. Intimidating in her size. No matter. She herself was strong, and she knew it. Her beautiful limbs didn’t need to have that freakish muscle mass to be powerful.

As the enforcer struck a pose for the admiring crowd, Sue took her opportunity. No grandstanding. No ostentatious muscle mass. Just a good, clean, superhumanly powerful sucker punch. That should do it.

Her fist impacted the brick—no, Sue could break bricks—harder than brick wall of the so-called bouncer’s abdominal muscles. Searing pain radiated through her fingers, past her wrist, and all the way up to her shoulders. Sue clutched her wrist as stars filled her vision. This was impossible! Even if she wasn’t as strong as this muscle freak, her body was tougher than this! What happened to her protection!?

“Oh, I didn’t see you there,” the bouncer declared arrogantly as she turned back around to face the blonde nuisance. “You want to rumble?”

Sue moved quickly, striking wildly with her good arm and throwing in a few ankle-biting kicks for good measure. But the brunette was as graceful as she was muscular. She weaved, parried, and dodged, blocking Sue’s attacks deftly without letting the smaller woman injure herself against her much more developed musculature.

Finally, the brunette shucked to the outside of Sue’s arm and parried the blow with her own forearm raised. Her biceps swelled from the pose.

Sue was panting weakly. She was outmatched. _Badly_ outmatched. And she knew it.

The bouncer grinned, bright and wide. She wasn’t even short of breath. Sue could barely stay on her feet as sweat dripped down her chin.

“My turn,” the bouncer sneered.

“No… wait!”

The sculpted amazon extended a single finger of her free hand and drove it deep into the side of Sue’s beautiful, hourglass flank.

A second later, Sue fell to the ground, completely winded. Gasping for her. A deep bruise was forming in her waist where the bouncer had poked her!

The crowd was closing in to get a better view, many of them hollering and cheering. The bouncer struck a bodybuilder pose, causing deep rips in her top. What remained was a flawless, tanned body, looking like it was carved out of marble, with warm and smooth mounds of mountainous muscle. She didn’t need a bronzing agent to accentuate her physique. Her physique accentuated her physique.

Some of the crowd were close enough for a hunched over Sue to reach out and touch their ankles. She tried to force them to obey her commands, to go and attack this bouncer. But all she got was a sharp ringing in her ears and a headache.

“Well? You want to leave on your own? Or you want me to carry you out like a sack of potatoes?” the bouncer asked, flexing an arm even harder. Her bicep swelled to double its already massive size.

Sue’s eyes wavered. She hobbled to her feet and began to scurry away, utterly defeated.

The band closed the fight number with some of the Ice Temple club regulars nodding at the familiar sight. Always a troublemaker every few months. More when a new Shard Strike event occurred.

Life went on.


## Chapter 2

_The pay’s not great, but I do kind of love my job,_ Olivia thought to herself in the women’s locker room of 24 Hour Paranatural Fitness.

She twirled her combination lock deftly and unlocked it with a soft clunk, making sure not to rip the entire metal mechanism off. A thick envelope sailed to the floor and stuck to the slightly sweaty gray floor.

Olivia bent over with the incredible flexibility that came so easily to her despite her bulk and picked it up. It was surprisingly thick and heavy. She experimentally tried shoving it through her locker vents, but it clearly did not fit.

She raised an eyebrow.

Inserting a fingernail, she sliced through the folded-over portion neatly. Olivia had always been slightly OCD about that.

She plucked the letter out of the envelope delicately. The paper really had some heft to it! Unfolding it and smoothing it carefully, she let the sliced bit of paper fall to the floor without a second thought. Yes, she wanted it neatly opened. No, she didn’t care what happened to it after that.

Even the paper it was written on was fancy. Neatly engraved too. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to somehow get this into her locker.

“Dear Olivia Lawrence,

I have been watching you with great interest. Fear not; I am on your side. We paranaturals need to stick together and look out for each other, as I’m sure you know after the San Francisco Para Riot.

I wish to welcome you to join us on New Ireland. We blah blah blah blah blah…”

Olivia’s eyes skimmed to the bottom of the letter. It was signed “Leila Leland, aka Leila Electric.” Wow, she’d been in the news for two months before a new outrage surfaced and people forgot all about her. What did that criminal vigilante despot idealist or whatever want with her?

Olivia snorted and tore up the heavy letter. The paper resisted the pull of her fingers for a brief moment before it ripped in half, loudly and irregularly, down the middle. She tore it into a few more pieces before dropping it in the wastebin.

She made her way back out into the gym area proper in her stretchy latex workout gear. Not even flexing her paranatural powers, her ripped physique and subtly striated muscles flexed with every step, every languid swing of her arms. Men and women couldn’t help but admire her, interrupting their own sets as the tall Olivia strolled by.

One of the men doing curls in the squat rack got a particularly nasty look from her and backed off. Some of the nearby gymgoers chuckled in approval. Olivia smiled at them and took the rack for herself, loading 500 pounds of weight onto the bar.

Bending over and getting underneath it, the lats and obliques on Olivia’s beautiful back puffed into view, feminine and strong. The professional grade bar looked like it was going to bend as it bore the incredibly heavy weights. She let it rest against her neck briefly as she brought her arms up and gripped.

Everyone held their breath at the sight of Olivia as she prepared to bring the bar off the rack. Even those who knew her and saw her every day at 24 Hour Paranatural Fitness. It was always such a sexy thrill to see her exert her strength. Rumors of her workouts had spread locally like wildfire, and some people signed up just to witness the event.

The bar rattled as it rolled off the rack. Olivia supported the weight across her broad shoulders, her biceps and triceps flaring into view, but not particularly tensed. Just for support.

Bending over, ass to grass, her powerful thighs exploded into stark definition, her butt strong, spherical, and bulging. Even her calves displayed a beautiful swell of strength, along with all of the lats, delts, and spinae all the way down her well-built back.

The audience gasped as she dug deep, using the whole range of motion and traveling _allll _the way down, slowly, enjoying the burning resistance. And then, smoothly but still slowly, keeping her back completely straight, eyes forward, her body straightened out, coming all the way back up in a triumphant rep.

Her muscles moved in perfect sync, like a symphony orchestra performing a gloriously dense and intricate piece of music. All the way down, then all the way up, her muscles took turns contracting, relaxing, swelling and rippling, her arms taut but soft and subtle compared to the thundering rhythmic beat of her lower body.

Twelve reps later, Olivia racked the bar and grabbed her towel. Her smooth skin was glistening, her modest breasts lightly speckled with perspiration.

“Wow… that’s incredible,” one of the girls marveled at the bar. “I’ll never be able to do that…”

Olivia smiled gently and walked over to her.

“How much do you squat?” she asked as she finished her fifteen second breather and prepared to perform her second set.

“Nothing like this, just some light dumbbells…” the petite woman gasped as Olivia started repping out more squats as smoothly as easily as the first set.

“Well…” Olivia inhaled on her way down and exhaled on her way up, speaking at the apex resting point of every rep, “it really just… depends on your… body weight. And form is… most important.” Another deep inhale, followed by another controlled exhale. “What matters most… is your health.”

She racked up again and dotted her forehead with her towel once more.

“Besides, it’s not a competition. Not really. Unless you’re actually, y’know, competing. You gotta do what’s good for your body,” Olivia encouraged gently.

The woman smiled and nodded in response. Still envious, but expectations tempered.

“Enough talking! Do the thing!” someone shouted from the back. “I’ll pay you $5,000!”

“Who said that?” Olivia beckoned them to step forward.

A gym regular approached, tripod and camera in hand.

“Hey, I know you. You sure?”

“Hell yes! Name’s Brian. Been saving up for this. Got some supporters too. We wanna see you do it! Would you mind?” He wiggled his recording hardware.

Olivia looked over at the gym owner who nodded in affirmation. She smiled at Brian.

“Sure thing.”


## Chapter 3

Olivia tapped a quick message to her boyfriend Jeff and told him she was about to make five large for doing “the thing.” He replied back instantly, “on the way.”

Five minutes later, the screech and burning smell of rubber followed the rushing boyfriend into the special area for Olivia’s “thing.”

The crowd eagerly followed Olivia’s lead to a modified racquetball court. Built to bear extreme weights, Jeffrey and a few staff members struggled to wrap thick, heavy chains around Olivia’s arms, legs, and torso, wrapping them around her tightly like some sort of mummy bandaged by industrial steel, brass, and aluminum loops. They finished it all off by securing it with large, thick padlocks at regular intervals, snapping them shut and pocketing the key.

“Y’all ready for this?” Olivia asked smugly. She wriggled her arms and shoulders in her prison, confirming that she was fully bound.

The crowd cheered and hollered.

“I’m rolling!” Brian shouted over the crowd.

“Poor widdle me, all locked up. How will I _eveeeer_ get out?” Olivia cheesecaked. She looked at Jeffrey as they gave each other a little smirk.

“Awwww,” the crowd cried in mock sympathy.

“What if I just… hrrg!”

The chains were suddenly squeezing her even tighter than before. Tight, steely cords bulged in Olivia’s long neck as her bonds began to tremble as though they were atoms being heated in a microwave.

Her entire body swelled with power, her muscles expanding outward, pushing forcefully against those metal links. Teasing, tantalizing the audience with the thought of her dense, nigh-invulnerable flesh, peaking into mountains with angry veins rippling through them… her neck was the only visible part of her, and it was growing thicker as Olivia surged ever taller with an intense look of concentration painted on her face.

The metallic rattling ceased. Grinding, rubbing, and the torturous squeal of metal being stressed replaced the sound of jiggling and clinking before. Olivia’s muscles, still concealed, were beginning to overflow her bonds. If anyone were close enough to her, they would have been able to feel the heat of the stressed chains.

But that would’ve violated the gym’s safety protocol, aptly named The Olivia Rule.

The purpose of the rule became clear a moment later. Large, bent links snapped loudly as the pressure from Olivia’s dense musculature was far too great for the metal to bear. The internal locking mechanisms of the padlock shattered first, followed by the chains around Olivia’s biceps. Link after link collapsed as the ones closest to the peaks of her feminine power flew apart, smashing into the walls and the cleared out space around her.

“Oh baby, I’m just getting started…” Olivia moaned.

Link after link crumbled now, revealing the glorious, envious peaks of Olivia’s tree-trunk thick arms and legs. The crowd cheered as Olivia lifted her bent arms up, tightening her fingers into fists as she shook the loose, useless metal away from her powerful body. Striking some angular poses, she gave her audience a show as she seductively flexed her muscle groups like a beautiful ballet, rippling through her arms, her shoulders, her back, all the way down through her glutes and legs like a choreographed ballet. This was the easiest $5,000 she’d ever made in her life.

Meanwhile, her boyfriend Jeff had conspicuously passed out in a corner, hiding away from view. After all, it wouldn’t do to have people know that she got stronger when she nullified someone.

As Olivia extricated herself from the useless metal heap she’d just created, someone dressed in a rather formal suit and a pair of dark sunglasses. came up to her. He didn’t recognize her, and the glasses served to hide where his gaze was. He was tall, solid, reasonably built. Naturally, Olivia stood taller in her power form. But she felt nothing from her nullifying field. Was he not a paranatural?

She tested him by rippling her absurdly defined abdominal muscles. Her obliques flexed and bulged along with them.

“Impressive,” he replied smoothly. “Care to arm wrestle? That is, in your normal form, if you please.”

Olivia was impressed at how easily he shrugged off her casual display.

“What’s in it for me?” she asked, as the gym owner came by and handed Olivia the majority of Brian’s payment.

“How about another 5,000? And maybe my respect.”

Olivia raised an eyebrow. “You serious?”

He lifted up his briefcase and slid the locks open. Neat, piled stacks of green flashed at her.

The crowd hollered again.

“Wow. Um. Yeah, sure.”

The mysterious man handed the briefcase to the gym owner. He took it, shrugged, and led them to a square table.

Olivia took a seat, shrinking down to a mere sub-seven feet tall as she walked. Just a regular girl next door who happened to be built like Ms. Olympia.

The mystery man took off his dark jacket, methodically detached his cufflinks, and began to unbotton his pure white shirt. He was quite barrel chested, and his arms bulged as he manipulated this laughably small buttons with his thick fingers. Perhaps Olivia had underestimated him.

He sat down and they clasped hands, elbows resting on the table. Olivia refocused her mind and attempted to nullify him again, looking forward to gain a temporary surge of power as she cut his access to his Shard-granted abilities.

Still nothing.

His grip was firm, his expression stoic. She could feel his hand applying pressure to hers as she squeezed back. They were clearly both testing each other, looking for a wince of pain, sizing each other up. Neither of them flinched.

The gym owner came up, placed both of his comparatively puny hands on these two behemoth paws.

“3… 2… 1… GO!”

Their arms wobbled as they pressed against each other, forearms and biceps straining. Their offhands were underneath the table, grippping each others’ to ensure no shenanigans would be taking place.

Meanwhile, Jeff had roused from his drained slumber. Noticing that the crowd was now huddling somewhere else, he quickly went over to survey the situation.

He found himself standing behind the burly agent. His eyes locked onto Olivia’s. She wasn’t… struggling with her opponent per say, but he could tell from the glint in her eye that she was looking for a boost.

Jeffrey squinted his eyes, steeling himself for that heady feeling to wash over him. He also began to back off slightly, trying to find a little nook to hide himself.

But nothing was happening. Had he moved too far?

Opening his eyes, he looked over at the arm wrestling match that was still unfolding. Olivia was scowling in anger!

He circled around to behind her and saw a placid smirk on the guy’s face. Was… was Olivia going to lose? Was _he_ nulling _her?_

Left to her own devices now, Olivia began to pour on the strength. Her own, natural, non-para-amplified strength. Grunting, she felt a surge of pride as his arm began to collapse under her power.

She looked up at him, expecting signs of a struggle, or a grimace of shame as he lost to a girl. But no, he was smiling!

Olivia pressed the back of his hand to the table with a victorious thud. The crowd cheered. Only, it didn’t feel like a victory.

“See me later for your money,” the gym owner instructed as he left the audience to holler and cheer. Meanwhile, Olivia took the time to talk to this mystery man in hushed tones.

“You… you nulled me! Did you lose on purpose?” she whispered.

“Well done, Miss Bennett. My name is Agent Washington. You can call me Thomas.”

“Agent?”

“No, Olivia. My first name is Thomas.”

Olivia stared at him. She did not laugh.

“Sorry, humor is not one of my strong suits.”

“Ah, uh. Sorry. I’m still in shock. So you were testing me?”

“Yes, that’s correct. And no, I did not lose on purpose. Honestly, I never stood a chance. You beat me fair and square. No powers.”

“What do you want with me?”

“Before I tell you, you tell me one thing. Are you a patriot?”

“What, like, do I serve my country? I pay my taxes, if that’s what you mean.” She tried to hold her pulse steady as she looked at the under the table money that she was about to collect.

“No Ma’am. I meant, do you believe in your country, heart and soul? Your president?”

“Hell no!” she blurted out. “I didn’t vote for that idiot. Or his competition! Er… sorry.”

“Very well.” He handed her a card with his name on it. “I’d like to invite you to work for us. If you can pass the training, there’s a job for you. Good day.”

He buttoned his shirt up, put on his jacket, and walked off. He was incredibly well put together. She could barely even see his arms trembling from exertion.

“Okay folks, show’s over!” she yelled to the crowd. “Looks like you got some bonus footage,” she smiled at Brian.

“Hell yeah! Best day ever!” he exclaimed.

When the crowd had dispersed, Jeffrey quickly ran up to her with a look of concern on his face.

“Who was _that!? _Are you okay?”

He reached out and squeezed her arm, unable to contain his involuntary moan from touching his girlfriend’s exquisite strength.

She stopped staring at the business card.. It saild ‘Secret Service’ on the front with an impressive seal and some phone numbers. It also had a dollar value scribbled on the back of it.

“I… I think we’re gonna be rich!” she squealed in delight.


## Chapter 4

The door to Olivia and Jeffrey’s new high-rise apartment burst open.

“You’re under arrest, criminal!” Olivia barged in, clearing the corners with her finger pistol.

“Oh officer, officer, I’m innocent!” Jeffrey pleaded.

“We’ll see about that…”

The two paused for a moment before breaking into laughter.

“I missed you! I know we just moved in, but it’s basically on your dime, so the place still feels… foreign to me,” Jeffrey explained. “But now you can come home after work, right? Training’s over?”

“Yeah babe,” she smiled. “I’m back.”

“What’s that?” He pointed to another white envelope in her hand.

The smile evaporated from Olivia’s face.

“It’s another letter from someone in the South Pacific Islands.”

“What? Like some sort of scam?” Jeffrey chuckled. “I thought they did those by email now.”

“No, these are real. Pretty sure, anyway. I found it in the passenger seat of my car. Except there’s no sign at all that my car was broken into. The first one was in my locker at 24 Hour ParaFit. Same thing there.”

“No way! Is this about that news from way back when? They wouldn’t stop talking about it. Something electricity, wasn’t it?”

“Yeah. Something like that.”

“What are you gonna do? Why don’t you tell your boss? Thomas.” His voice betrayed a niggling concern he’d been harboring.

“I just got the job; I don’t want to cause any trouble yet. What if they think I’m some sort of spy?”

“I bet the longer you wait, the more they think you _are_ one.”

“And did I detect a hint of jealousy?” Olivia changed the subject.

“No!” Jeffrey averted his eyes.

“Oh, I do! Don’t be concerned, babe. He’s not a threat to you.”

But Jeffrey’s insecurity was pouring through.

“He’s so… strong. And big. Like you,” he admitted.

But his feelings of inadequacy were soon replaced by the familiar thrill of getting nulled out. He rubbed his eyes, clearing his vision as he witnessed Olivia rapidly stripping out of her sexy formal agent clothing as she hulked out ever larger by the second.

“But I can’t do this to him, can I? Not like with you…” Olivia purred as she traced a finger over her abs before inserting it into her panties.

“Olivia! I… I was pouring my heart out to you. I know it might just be a me-problem, but I’m serious!”

She rushed at him and tackled him onto their bed, absolutely dwarfing him with her strength and stature.

“And so am I, Jeff. You don’t have to worry about anything like that.”

Olivia pinned his arms back. Jeff was wiry and strong, but he was no match for Olivia even when she hadn’t hulked out. Obviously.

“Mmf!” Jeff’s eyes opened wide in shock as Olivia’s strong but soft fingers ripped his jeans apart and began to stroke the bulge forming in his underwear. He tried to wriggle free from her brute strength, but she knew all about this song and dance.

“Stop squirming, little boy! I’m working here!” Olivia scolded as she nulled him out harder. The arm that she was stroking his growing erection with rippled with cords of muscle and bulged with power, her fingers gripping him tighter. Her ass became even more swollen as well, those perfect rounded spheres capturing his vision as it lowered toward his body. With one motion, she fluidly sat down and parked her rear on his chest, pinning him inexorably to the bed as she continued to touch his sensitive cock.

Jeff squirmed and thrashed as he reveled in the erotic feeling of complete powerlessness.

Olivia continued to idly run her brawny finger up and down his shaft while she sent a text on her phone. She squealed in delight when whoever she was texting responded.

“What is it?” Jeff asked eagerly. “Is it…”

“Shh! Don’t interrupt me! It’s not your turn to speak!” Olivia teased as she drove her glutes deeper into his chest, driving the breath out of him and threatening to squash him. The sudden force and slight asphyxiation caused his fully erect member to thrash in her powerful fingers—which only served to bring him closer to orgasm.

Olivia continued to stroke his iron while she gave him a show with her free arm, curling her bicep into a beautiful balled peak of her perfect, dense flesh. Every contraction of her arm synchronized to another swollen throb, another uncontrollable twitch of his erection against the silky soft skin of her irrepressible fingers. Every time she felt him nearing an eruption, she would squeeze even harder, sending stars through his vision and denying him release. Or even worse, she would let go entirely, cutting off his stimulation, leaving him panting and whimpering.

“Hey Liv, Jeff! I came as fast as I could! You left the window open for me this time!” Cathy announced her own arrival as she soared to a standstill in midair.

“Ooh, you’re just on time!” Olivia chirped.

She locked eyes with her blonde, beautiful best friend. With a mischievous smirk, she nulled Cathy as well.

“Heyyyy! No fair!” Cathy whined from the floor as she struggled to climb to her feet.

But Olivia was bulking up even _further_ as she reveled in the power. Her muscle form swelled, expanding, growing as her tight hand squeezed and twisted over the oversensitive, wet glans of Jeffrey’s begging erection…

He spurted all over himself. Violently. His girth pulsed against her grip, and she cooed and allowed him to come, firing thick jets of semen that splashed against the side of her thigh.

“Damn Liv… you got him good,” Cathy beamed as she approached the duo. “Can you give me my powers back? Please? Pretty please?”

Olivia’s arm shot out, wrapped around her friend’s supermodel-like tiny waist, and lifted her off the floor in a single motion. Maneuvering Cathy like the barbie doll she was, Olivia climbed off of a gasping, recovering Jeff, easily shoving him to the side of their queen-size bed. She deposited her girlfriend right next to him and crawled on top of her properly, her muscular legs on either side of Cathy’s svelte body.

“Liv!! You’re so strong!” Cathy cried as Olivia began to squeeze her thighs together, grinding her own aching pussy up and down Cathy’s lithe body.

“And you like it,” Olivia snarled, baring her fangs. She reached behind her back with one arm and ripped her friend’s shorts and panties to shreds, confirming what she already knew. Her friend was sopping wet.

“Oh Liv…” Cathy moaned, her shimmering golden blonde hair framing her beautiful face like an angel.

“And don’t think you’re getting off so easy!” Olivia barked predatorily, grabbing Jeff with one arm and stroking his flaccid penis back to attention. “You better get ready. You like my muscles? Well, my kegels are going to snap your dick off inside my hungry pussy!”

Her naughty words meant Jeff was erect as soon as she’d finished her sentence. Olivia laughed darkly.

It wasn’t _that_ long ago, when…


---

“Fire!!!”

Olivia, Cathy, and Jeff looked at each other. Fire, on a boat?

They were standing on the deck of a yacht, anchored and docked right off the shore of Catalina Island. Young professionals enjoying the start of their new lives as adults, sipping champagne at Cathy’s company’s expense.

The three turned their heads toward the direction of the screaming. They were right on time to see a translucent, glowing crystal violently slam into the stairs that led to the cabin, cutting off the main exit and entrance. Arcing electricity burst forth chaotically from the mysterious ethereal construct, igniting a strange, alien fire.

“What the hell!?” Cathy yelled over the cacophony.

“It’s… it’s happening! Here!?” Olivia gasped.

“Guys! Run!!!” Jeffrey grabbed the two women’s arms and ran to the edge of the pleasure boat, looking for some life jackets and perhaps an escape boat.

And then a bolt of electricity shot right through all three of them.

The newly minted professionals all froze as the sensation of cold burning coursed through their bodies. Their screams caught in their throats as the energies swirled within them, trying to ignite their flesh and leave behind only ash. But the three had too much fortitude to give in like that.

As Jeffrey curled into a little whimpering ball, fighting and holding on against the shard’s energies, Olivia remained on her feet as her flesh began to grow denser, stronger. Her nerves responded to the forceful, demanding power by simply triggering her body to grow _more_ hard, powerful muscle to resist and ultimately contain that power. Already a fitness nut, Olivia’s entire body packed on the sort of definition she’d only dreamt about, until even that wasn’t enough. Then she surged in height, looking like some sort of divine Amazon.

And as for Cathy… the willowy slender blonde was undergoing her own transformation, but in a different direction. Just as her friend grew stronger, Cathy’s fetching but slightly pudgy body was thinning, all of the fat that was melting away from her midsection seemingly traveling to her breasts as they swelled in contrast to her new, slender, modelesque frame.

Cathy regained her senses first, the energy having done much less work on her than the still hulkifying Olivia and quivering Jeffrey. She marveled at her new limbs and generous bosoms. She reached up for them and cupped them, gently massaging those sexy orbs. Wait, where those _her _hands? Even her hands looked sexy!

“Cathy!” Jeffrey called out. He was the next to recover.

“Jeff! What’s happening!”

“You’re… you’re flying!”

“Eep!!”

Cathy jerked around in midair as she panicked. As she floated nearer to a still incapacitated Olivia, she collapsed to the ship’s deck. Dusting herself off, she got back on her feet.

“Is… is Liv okay?!” She stared at her still bulking friend.

“I don’t know! But we have to get out of here! You can fly now!? Can you take some of these people away?”

“I’ll try! What about Liv!?”

“I’ll stay here with her! Go go go!”

Jeff watched as Cathy ran toward the cabin, gathering people into her arms. Her own feet left the floor, but the two people she was attempting to carry stayed rooted. The blonde supermodel was visibly struggling with the weight of two fully grown humans. Making a snap decision, she let go of the couple and confirmed with one woman that she would be taking the other first. She nodded in agreement fiercely as the two embraced briefly, and Cathy flew off with one of them toward the not-so-distant shore, wobbling under the strain of carrying another human by her armpits.

“Olivia! Olivia!!” Jeff yelled to try to snap her out of it. He reached out for her body, but a whip of lightning slapped his hand, as if to scold him for trying to disturb something important.

He watched in awe as she grew taller by the minute. God, she was so _tall_ now! And had the musculature to match! Even despite the chaos and panic, he was beginning to get erect. He could only imagine how much his girlfriend could curl now, those muscles and veins pumping fiercely. Or how much she could bench.

Speaking of chest exercises, her breasts were growing enormous! He’d always been obsessed by how well Olivia could flex her pecs, making her boobs bounce. He bet if his penis were trapped in between them, she could shatter him with a little twitch!

Cathy was back now, looking a little worse for wear. She instructed the next rescuee to climb on her back, piggyback style. Some of the other bystanders argued and yelled that it was their turn, but the calmer-minded ones stepped in to assist their flying supermodel. She gratefully thanked them and floated off her feet toward shore again.

“I feel… _strong_! Oh my god, the fire! Jeff!”

Olivia was back. And better than ever.

“Olivia!! Cathy can fly! She’s helping people get to shore, one at a time!”

“What about you!? Are you okay? What can you do!?” she shouted back at her comparatively much smaller boyfriend.

“I… I don’t know?!” He squeezed his eyes shut tight, but nothing came.

“Well, what can _I _do!?”

“Jeff! Liv!” Cathy came flying back overhead, ignoring the protests of the small crowd of people waiting to be rescued. She lost control of her flight and nearly crashed into a heap on the floor, but Olivia caught her at the last second. As she hulked out even further.

“We have to get out of here! Cathy, what’s wrong!? Are you tired?”

“I… I can’t fly around you!” Cathy exclaimed. “I thought I was just getting used to it at first, but it’s something different!”

“What!? Shit!!!!”

“Cathy! Go, keep flying those people away! It sounds like you’re no good around Olivia anyway! And it looks like Olivia’s plenty strong…”

The two women looked at each other before realizing that Jeff was entirely right. The muscle goddess put her slender friend on the floor. They nodded at each other. Cathy ran back toward the crowd, testing her flight as her feet hovered again.

“What should I do, Jeff!?” Olivia yelled.

“Umm… can you check the cabin!? The entry is blocked by a crystal! Are you strong enough to dig some alternate way in!?”

“I’ll try!”

“In the meantime, if you’re not around me, maybe I can figure out what I can do…”

Olivia went to examine the entrance. The shard was still striking, its ethereal fire spreading ominously. She went to the side of the structure and experimentally pressed her steely cabled arm against it. Yes, this would work.

She began to rip the structure apart, tearing a large hole into the side wall like a bulldozer, fueled by pure, feminine muscle. About twenty eyes met her gaze, first in shock at this Amazon who had saved their life. Then it softened to relief. Olivia beckoned them out.

“Danny! Be brave! Let’s go!” a mother called out to her young son as she cradled an infant in her arms.

“Let’s go! Let’s go!” Olivia yelled, trying to pull the final victims out into open air where Cathy could fly them to safety.

But Danny was crying and backpedaling, too scared of the green and pink flames.

And with one final burst of energy, the crystal shard unleashed all of its latent power. The flames roared over the impromptu entrance that Olivia had carved with her bare hands.

“Aaah!” screamed the mother, falling backwards.

Without hesitation, Olivia reached through the flames and pulled the mother and baby through. She gestured toward the front of the deck where Cathy had nearly finished ferrying everyone off the boat.

“Danny!” she protested.

Olivia dived headfirst into the fiery prison and grabbed the traumatized child. She ignored his protests, grabbing him in one arm and headed toward the open dusk awaiting them. But he screamed and struggled as the fire rose before them. If Olivia pulled any harder, she’d probably rip his arm off!

“Danny! I’m Olivia! We have to get out! You’re going to have to be brave and go, okay?”

“No! No! Mama!!!”

“Danny! Listen to the strong lady!” The mother reached out with an arm.

Before the child could protest, Olivia got her arm beneath and behind him and practically flung him through the flames.

And then the entire room was engulfed in flame. Olivia gasped as its otherworldly fumes invaded her senses and paralyzed her. She collapsed onto her side. The last thing she remembered before her vision went dark was seeing and feeling the dancing fire searing her flesh.


---

“Olivia. Olivia, you’re awake? Are you okay?”

She coughed and sputtered. The salty brine of seawater coated her mouth. Next to her were Jeff and Cathy. All three of them were soaking wet.

“The boat burned down. Cathy saw you floating out there, but she couldn’t get close to you. Thankfully, she directed the rescue boat and they managed to grab you. Are you okay? Can you talk?”

But Olivia was just staring at the fire still burning out on the ocean. She scampered backwards in total fright, kicking up sand as she got to her feet and ran far, far away from those long-lived, looming flames.


## Chapter 5

“Congratulations on your new line of work, Olivia,” Edgar, the owner of Ice Temple club told her in the back management rooms. “To be honest, I was kind of hoping it wouldn’t work out for you. A bouncer who’s a null who gets stronger when she does it is exactly the kind of enforcer we need. Probably the only kind that matters in this world now.”

“You could pay me more,” Olivia winked.

“Ha! You want me to toss in a bottomless pension while I’m at it?”

“If you don’t mind.”

“Well, congratulations. Here’s to Olivia Lawrence, one of the best Ice Temple employees we ever had. If you’re ever looking for work again, don’t hesitate to call us.”

Olivia, Jeff, and Edgar raised a glass.

“Thanks, Ed. I really liked working here. If the government spook life doesn’t work out, I’ll be sure to head right back.”

“Hell, I meant it, but I also don’t want to see you again. You deserve more, girl. Well, how about part ownership? If your business acumen is up to snuff, that is.”

“Sure, sure. We’ll see.”

They all laughed, but it was followed by a somber silence. They all knew that Olivia had outgrown the chic club scene. The down-to-earth moment reminded her that she’d found yet another letter from Leila Electric in her _purse_. The only time she was without it was when it lay idle in her new high-rise apartment. And again, no signs of break in, no news of strange activity in the entire building, nada, zip, zilch. This was getting scary.

After the three emptied their glasses, Olivia and Edgar shook hands.

“I’ll miss that handshake of yours,” Edgar grimaced as he cradled his hand.

“I”ll miss you too, Ed. Really.”

“You got a good one, buddy. Take good care of her.”

“Heh. I’ll do my best, but she’s a little unstoppable sometimes,” Jeff chuckled.

“Well here. Go ahead and take something top shelf. On me. Now you two go out and have some fun tonight.”

Jeff and Olivia walked out of the slightly distant room and back toward the thumping beat of the club.

“Nice boss you had,” Jeff remarked.

“Yeah,” Olivia replied curtly. She couldn’t help it. After two years of being a bouncer and now being trained in law enforcement, she instinctively scanned her surroundings, noting exits (of which she was already familiar in this establishment), and looked for odd behavior.

And sure enough, she was Johnny on the spot with her diligence. Her eyes squinted as they landed on that blonde mind controlling supermodel, the last one she’d disgracefully ejected. The hell was she doing here? Revenge, surely. Hadn’t she learned her lesson?

Olivia was about to inform the bartender surreptitiously so as to avoid a scene, but Sue dashed any hopes of that. The two stared daggers at each other before Olivia heard a piercing scream from her left.

She turned her head to find an onrushing ball of flame, larger than her entire body.

Olivia froze. Absolutely paralyzed. The flame singed everyone in its path with its glancing touch, but it was going to hit her head on. And all she could see was herself, trapped in hell in the cabin of that yacht, wondering if she would burn to death before she drowned, or vice versa.

She couldn’t even breathe. Olivia closed her eyes and just awaited the end. Waited for it all to go away.

“Olivia!!!” Jeff screamed, tackling her as hard as he could. He barely pushed her prodigious bulk out of the way, but a fair portion of her smart pantsuit had caught fire.

“Come on, Olivia! You’re trained! We gotta do something!”

She gasped, able to function again without a large ball of burning flame headed her way. “I… can’t!!” she wailed.

“Yes you can! You saved all those people on the yacht! And now, you’re going to help me save all the people here! There’s a pyrokinetic in the club… if you just null him, it’ll be all over!”

It sounded like a good plan. Until one by one, the clubbers screamed Olivia’s name like a death curse and began to rush toward her.

“Get her!!”

“Kill the bitch!”

“For Sue!!!”

“Fuck,” Jeff spat.

“Jeff! I can take care of these puppets and Sue. Can you, just, find the flame guy…” Olivia grunted as her extended arms held the on-rushers at bay. Her extra height and lengthy limbs made them seem like angry children. But they were still coming, and she wasn’t in her muscle form.

“Olivia! I don’t think I can handle the pyrokinetic!” Jeff protested. “You can’t actually be hurt by fire! Not really, anyway! You have to get over this!”

“I… No!” she screamed in protest.

The crowd of Sue’s assaulting puppets was gaining steam now. Even Olivia was getting pushed back.

“Just null me and take care of the pyro! Get these bystanders out of the way with your muscles!”

Olivia tried to focus her powers, but the sight of the fire burning away at her sleeves and licking her flesh dashed any hopes of that.

“Fuck fuck fuck!” she wailed. “Fine Jeff, we’ll do it your way! Go!”

“Aren’t you going to…”

“I SAID GO!” she yelled.

“Okay! You’ll be fine!” he reassured her before slithering away to find the mastermind. He hid in the shadows and kept his eyes open. It was hard not knowing what his actual goddamn powers were.

“Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!” Olivia apologized as she shoved the innocent bystanders aside one by one. She tried to be gentle, but they continued to climb on her back or claw at her legs, slowing her advance. She simply wasn’t going to make any headway like this.

She looked up above her at the decorative snowflake hanging from the ceiling. She’d never tried it, but it looked sturdy enough…

Shoving her arms out and sending the crowd sprawling, she leapt high into the air and grabbed onto one of the available perches of the beautiful ornament. It turned out to be a double-edged sword. She could see both Sue and the pyrokinetic clearly from her vantage point.

And they could see her too.

As soon as she called out their locations, another enormous fireball, twice as large as the first, headed her way. Her face went pale as her arm lost all strength. The flames wrapped and flowed all around her, constricting her like a straight jacket that even all of her strength could not break. She fell to the floor like a fiery stone.

“No…” she whimpered, lying there as the crowd of puppets advanced on her. Just like in the yacht. Surrounded. Immobile. Helpless.

And then all of the puppets ceased their creeping advance. They looked around at each other, utterly dazed and confused. The club security came to escort them away, and Olivia, still prone on the floor, was greeted with the triumphant view of Jeffrey with a broken wine bottle in his hand, standing over a limp Sue.

“No! ARRRRGH!” the pyro yelled as he breathed a thin line of flame Jeff’s way. He panicked and rounded a corner.

“Jeff!!!” Olivia screamed.

Before she knew it, she was on her feet. Charging the callous fire breathing asshole who apparently wasn’t being mind controlled by Sue.

Like a bull rushing at full speed, she drove her considerable weight into him and slammed him into a wall, knocking him out cold.

The fight was over.

Ice Temple club was a mess, its signature snowflake on fire and a little more tilted than before. Local police and parademics showed up in the aftermath, assisting the civilians.

“Ma’am, you’re on fire!” one of them exclaimed. “Let me just…”

He sprayed the fire extinguisher over her tattered clothing. She was almost completely exposed on one half of her body. The only sign that she’d even been burning was the ash of her clothes and some slight discoloration of her skin.

“Huh? Oh, thanks…”

The police had an unconscious Sue in cuffs as they escorted her out of the building.

“Hey, you need to be careful with her. She’s a mind controller,” Olivia warned.

“We got it,” one of them replied. His partner tapped his forehead, indicating to Olivia that he was their team’s null.

Jeffrey reappeared by her side, finally.

“Told you you could do it.”

“God, talk about throwing me in the deep end. I don’t think it’s going to be that easy. But it was a first step.”

She punched Jeff in the arm casually, hard enough to bruise him.


## Epilogue

Agent Washington sat in the driver seat of his car in his agency’s parking lot, awaiting news from his subordinate. A long, _long,_ shapely bare leg from the thigh down materialized out of the thick concrete wall, followed by another. Black high heels, a short pencil skirt, and then the rest of her body followed. White blouse, breasts to die for, languid arms swinging, porcelain pale skin. Pink lips, heart-shaped face, and almond eyes.

If Washington weren’t so good at his job, he’d be drooling.

Agent Li, codename Summer Ghost, finally popped out of the concrete wall. Only to phase through Washington’s black Ford sedan and sit down in the passenger seat, all without opening the door. She crossed her sexy stems, the lack of legroom not bothering her in the slightest. They swung idly through the dashboard of his car, back and forth, back and forth.

Seduction was another one of her key traits, and she had it in spades.

“Well?” he asked.

“She keeps throwing them away. She’s obviously worried that ‘Leila’ can get to her anytime, but she’s still ignoring it.”

“Good. I’ll confront her about it and see how she reacts. But she’s passing all our tests with flying colors so far. We need more nulls. _Powerful _nulls. They’re the only hope for the future security of our damn planet.”
