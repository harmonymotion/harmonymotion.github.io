# November 2022 Roadmap

Gobble gobble gobble! Anyone making a turkey galantine or balantine like Jacques Pepin? Anyway...

Here's what we have planned for this month:

## Commissions

```
* A new Cirraneverse
* A new windy story
* Master PC - The Submissive Master Rebooted
* A transformation and beautydom story
* A magical breast story
* A sequel to Zelena's SSU debut
```

## Patreon
```
* NEW Evil Girl serial, working title DPS: Domination, Power, Sex
* Mary and Stu
* NSFW pack
```

Reminder to all patrons that Super Supporters and Super Lover Lovers get coupons for story and art commissions! We've had so many cashed in  and they really add up. Last month we had 3 coupons redeemed!

Looking forward to a productive November all!
