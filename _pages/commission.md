## So you want a commission
Great! I am very easy to get along and work with. Here's what to do:

Contact me on discord (harmonymotion#2098) or email (harmonymotionfiction@gmail.com)

### Writing
1. Let me know what kind of story you want.
- Kinks, specific story beats, that kind of stuff. Things that are important to you that you cannot do without. The more you tell, the less I'll ask :)
2. I will work with you and draft an outline.
3. Once you sign off, I begin writing in earnest.
- You will have full access to the document as I work, any time you like.
4. Give me feedback, either during or after I am finished writing.
5. I touch it up based on your feedback and give it a final edit.
6. Enjoy the finished product!

### Art
Give me as much detail as possible. How the character looks physically (eye color, face shape, hair color, body shape, lips, nose, everything... mold it all to your desire.) What is he or she wearing? Details, details, details.

Pose, scenery, expression.

We will generate a preview for you to examine.

If you are okay with it, we produce the final piece of art.

**If you want any changes, the time to call it out is during the preview phase! We will accommodate changes after the final piece is complete, but excessive tweaks will cost more!**

We own and retain the rights to our work.

### Prices
Story: 4-5c a word. Rate varies depending on content.
Art: $30 an image, plus $10 for initial creation of model.

We charge half upfront and half upon completion.

## What people are saying about us
> Truly an awesome story that I am glad I was able to comission. Timewise Harmonymotion was on the ball and got back to me anytime I had a suggestion or request and overall I can't wait to commission them again. Truly awesome work!!  
- Olo

> Very happy with the results of my commission.  I've been a big fan of SWM type stuff (Super babes doing super stuff) and threw my story pitch to HM.  HM was very receptive and communicated on a daily basis.  Was able to take my ideas, ask for clarification, make changes and drive on.  Easy going.  As the story took shape I made very few requests for changes and they accommodated.  Ever have a desire to have your fantasy put to print?  You won't be disappointed and you'll get what you pay for.  The story will hopefully fuel more efforts and writing.  The images were the icing on top.

> The response (especially on the artwork) was incredibly fast and the transparency during the writing process is useful to reassure you 're getting the best story you can get.

> I like seeing my ideas coming to life, but liking it more when we both enjoy it. I'm glad to have chosen harmonymotion to write up my idea and hope to hire them once more in the future ðŸ™‚  
- danio13

> It was an amazing experience. HM is a super-fast writer and will make everything as close as possible to the request. If youâ€™re thinking about bringing your story idea into reality, I highly recommend commissioning him. I even got a 3d image for my story.

> So far working with Harmonymotion in my commission has been a very enjoyable experience. Very professional and always available to talk about how to improve the story.
> I love the ideas that have been introduced and very much appreciate the comments and critique of the ideas that sound good in my head, but wouldn't work that well in practice. This is the type of talent and honesty that everyone looking to commission a good story should look for in a writer.
